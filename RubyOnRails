Step 1 Create a directory jtp in which all the code will be present and will navigate from the command line.
mkdir jtp  

Step 2 Change the directory to jtp

cd jtp  
Step 3 Create a new application with the name helloWorld.

rails new helloWorld  
You will see something as shown in the below snapshot.

A helloWorld directory will be created in your system. Inside this folder there will be many files and subfolders which is actually the Rails application.

Step 4 Move in to your above created application directory that is helloWorld.

cd helloWorld  
Step 5 Rails 5 has no longer a static index page in production. There will not be a root page in the production, so we need to create it. First we will create a controller called hello for our home page.

rails generate controller hello

You will see something as shown in the above snapshot.

Step 6 Now we need to add an index page.

In file app/views/hello/index.html.erb, write

<h2>Hello World</h2>   
<p>   
  Today is 23r March, Thursday.   
</p>  
Step 7 Now we need to route the Rails to this action. Edit the config/routes.rb file to set the index page to our new method.

Add the following line in the routes.rb file,

root 'hello#index'  
Step 8 Now you can verify the page by running your server.

rails server

rails server -p portNumber
